# 🎓 About Me

I am Zeyu Qin (秦泽钰), a Ph.D. student of [Computer Science & Engineering](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/) at [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/) (HKUST). My advisors are [Prof. Minhao Cheng](https://cmhcbb.github.io/) and [Prof. Nevin L. Zhang](https://www.cse.ust.hk/faculty/lzhang/). Recently, I also collaborate with [Prof. Li Shen](https://sites.google.com/site/mathshenli/home), [Prof. Ruoyu Sun](https://ruoyus.github.io/), and [Dr. Yongqiang Chen](http://lfhase.win/). My research interest is broadly on _AI Alignment, Safety, and Interpretability_.  

Currently, I am focusing on:  
1) **How to obtain better and more safe Supervision for oversighting LLMs**;   
2) **Eliciting Honest Latent Knowledge (ELK) of LLMs**;  
3) **Faithful Evaluation of LLMs**.  


_I am very fortunate to have worked with lots of distinguished researchers: Prof. Baoyuan Wu, Dr. Yanbo Fan, Prof. Hongyuan Zha, Dr. Jiancong Xiao, and Prof. Piji Li. I had an amazing four years at LGU with my good friends from Room 310 and Room 224. Miss you, guys!_
